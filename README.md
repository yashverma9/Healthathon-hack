### Sarv Sahamati
### Consent Manager for all!

### The problem Sarv Sahamati solves
Existing consent managers have various drawbacks such as:
- Overwhelming UI/UX
- No support for local languages
- No support for feature phones
- Hard to navigate through consent flows for functionally illiterate and elderly people

What’s the use of having a PHR system if it’s not accessible to everyone!

Hence we have developed Sarv Sahamati, the ultimate solution to all the above mentioned problems. It aims to be the one fit for all kind of people of our country with the following feautures:
- Accessible, interactive and easy to use interface
- Voice assisted flow and multilingual support
- Including all essential health features in one app
- Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) for feature phones

We have used Finarkein- Flux Sandbox APIs for the development of our application

Our solution consists of 3 different applications:
1) App for people comfortable with smart phones
2) App for functionaly illiterate and elderly people
3) IVR System for people having feature phones

### Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges while designing UI/UX flows for functionally illiterate and elderly people. Also getting text and audio data for regional languages was tedious job. Initially, understanding the sandbox APIs was also another challenge.
